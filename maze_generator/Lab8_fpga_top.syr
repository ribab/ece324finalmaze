WARNING:Xst:1290 - Hierarchical block <MC> is unconnected in block <Lab8_fpga_top>.
   It will be removed from the design.
INFO:Xst:2261 - The FF/Latch <rgb_reg_0> in Unit <MRT> is equivalent to the following 7 FFs/Latches, which will be removed : <rgb_reg_1> <rgb_reg_2> <rgb_reg_3> <rgb_reg_4> <rgb_reg_5> <rgb_reg_6> <rgb_reg_7> 
WARNING:Xst:1710 - FF/Latch <rgb_reg_0> (without init value) has a constant value of 0 in block <MRT>. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.
